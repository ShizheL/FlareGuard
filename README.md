# FlareGuard

Due to blockchain anonymity, a major issue in the DeFi space is assessing a user's credibility. In order to combat this, we developed FlareGuard: an AI-powered credibility checker. FlareGuard leverages machine learning techniques to detect anomalous wallet behaviour, helping lenders and exchanges assess risk without off-chain identity checks. Using the Flare FDC and Coston API, we extract key wallet features and apply Isolation Forest, LOF, and One-Class SVM models for anomaly detection. A Flask-based web app provides real-time risk assessment. In the future, we hope to use a larger set of data and train more ML models to enhance accuracy, making DeFi safer and more transparent for the wholeÂ community.
